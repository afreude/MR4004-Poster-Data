We propose replacing the tree at the completion of the project under our SIP Permit.  The tree replacement scope would include re-installation of any accessories related to the tree such as silva cells as required by SDOT.  The tree removal/replacement is required for the following reasons:  · Site Constraints – The property is bounded by Dexter Ave N – East, Mercer – South, Aurora - West and alley - north.  We are limited to Dexter Ave N for load/trucking/concrete pumping/etc due to logistics issues with all other elevations (elevation difference, traffic volumes/safety, trucking access).  These considerations limit trucking and logistics to the Dexter Ave N Location. If this tree were to remain it would hamper our ability to fully utilize the proposed trucking area.    · Public/Pedestrian/Bicycle Safety - Our proposed street use configuration relies on shifting the bike and traffic lanes to provide a trucking lane.  The location of the tree renders the trucking lane useless for many means/methods related tasks. This includes potential conveyor/mass excavation export, tower crane/manlift erect and dismantle, concrete truck and pump. Tree Health – If the tree were to remain during construction it would require significant pruning and be at risk for damage despite tree protection measures that would be implemented by BNB. Our proposal to remove and replace the tree would ensure the ROW is returned with a healthy tree at the completion of the project.",,

Pruning Specification: -Selectively remove live branches 2-6 inches in diameter located in the entire upper and outer canopy to help reduce spread and reduce stress on defects located at the branch unions/weight on trunk defects,and to raise lower canopy to approx. 20 feet over existing grade -Remove all visible deadwood 2 inches in diameter and larger throughout the entire canopy. Notice -Retain all well-attached interior branches and sprouts -Pruning cuts to be primarily branch removal cuts and reduction cuts from 2 to 6 inches in diameter -Limited heading cuts up to 4 inches in diameter may be utilized only when necessary to minimize risk where there are no healthy laterals to reduce the branch to, and a removal cut would be so large that it would harm the health or structure of the tree -Dead branches below 2"" diameter to remain unless they pose an unacceptable risk to people or property below -Do not remove more than 15% of the live canopy Notes:-Tree is vigorous and is growing/compartmentalizing very well, though large decay pockets/cavities have been found near the root flare, main trunk, and some leaders in the upper canopy -Large squirrel nest in upper canopy over house Follow-up Monitoring / Recommendations: Retrenchment pruning is a long-term management strategy for mature trees and requires regular follow-up pruning as the tree continues to age. STC recommends a follow-up assessment in 1 year. The amount of pruning required in future years may change based on the tree's health, condition, changing site conditions, and the tree's response to pruning activities. Tree owner or manager should monitor the tree for changes in condition after unusual wind or storm events. Pruning will follow ANSI A300. Arborists adhering to the ANSI A300 pruning standard will not: leave branch stubs, make unnecessary heading cuts, cut into branch collars, top or lion's tail trees, or remove more than 25% live foliage within the entire tree or off a single branch.","02/17/2024",

I was finally getting around to doing some landscape maintenance on the parking strip as there was a bush/shrub that had become highly overgrown. My plan was a simple removal of this bush/shrub that had grown around one of my tree's. As I trimmed away at the bush/shrub and the dirt beneath and surrounding it, it became clear that this bush was somehow ""connected"" to the tree at its base.At this time my neighbor came over and informed me the ""bush"" I was cutting back were actually ""suckers"" that grow from vulnerable/in-distressed tree's and that these tree's had been long since dead.At this point I stopped to reassess the situation as I had not planned to trim or prune the tree's at all, however, if they were dead, it seemed the responsible thing to do to remove them to ensure no future issues occurred (intertwining with power lines, issues with roots and water lines, wind storms blowing branches down onto cars or people, etc.).Upon looking into the situation I was told I would need a permit to remove these tree's, even if they were dead. I am applying for a free of charge permit to remove these dead tree's. As they are not overly large I am capable of doing so safely myself piece by piece. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.Joe","09/19/2024",

They will be planted in an unpaved alley that is not driveable and is choked with blackberries. It's between Wolcott Ave. S and Wabash Ave. S. At the end of the alley is a massive tree that cannot be cut down because it is deemed ""historical"" (according to our next door neighbor who wanted to cut it down years back, applied to the city, and was denied). Wabash Avenue is filled with duplexes owned by slumlords who trash their tenants' property, a junk car lot, and folks with mental health issues who trash their yards and the planting strip by the Rose Street bus stop. We have compassion for them and all people who struggle with poverty which is usually not their fault, but we don't want to see the trash any more. Furthermore, there have been several shootings over there since we moved here in 2017. The trees would be good for everyone's emotional and physical health. Until we cleaned it in 2017, the alley was filled with trash which had been accumulating for some time (tossed there by the landlords or tenants). My husband, brother, and I spent a weekend trying to beautify it: we cleaned the alley, brought the trash to the dump, removed blackberries, and bought some western red cedars with our own money (costing hundreds of dollars). After planting those cedars, the landlord across the alley had them bulldozed and destroyed the trees, very much to our chagrin. The man operating the bulldozer said the landlord was thinking about expanding his tenants' driveway, although he never did. So a tragic waste of some beautiful baby cedars. We didn't realize until recently that we need a permit to plant trees in the alley at all. We hope that with an official permitting process and a conversation with our neighbors, we can make this happen this time around.Finally, the alley is a boggy wetland in the winter and the trees will be happy there, according to Lou from SPU. Trees will improve life for all in this under-resourced area which is severely lacking in trees. We all deserve the greenery that the wealthy folks up north and to the east have access to.

We opted for the placement of the street tree on-site to avoid SIE or SIP. You can cite the powerline clearance as additional rationale.    ? SDOT noted that the design team will need to apply for an exception in order to avoid a street improvement for the required planting strip (5’-6”). During the meeting it was discussed that the best solution may be a 8’ sidewalk with street trees/ planting on back side of sidewalk and located on property).This option will not require a street improvement exception (SIE) or a SIP. DCG - SDOT to provide additional clarity regarding permitting expectations to avoid a SIP. SIP required for 2,000 sq. ft. of impervious surface replaced. SIP also required if the project proposes to remove the retaining wall and this requires regrading the alley.    ?

We had Dog Smith (ISA Certified Arborist PN 6116-A/TRAQ) assess this tree. Per his report, at the base of the tree there is a significant amount of decay that extends from the root flare all the way up to chest height or perhaps higher in the tree. During the site visit, Smith sounded the entire pedestal region with a nylon hammer and thought that 75% of the circumference of the tree sounded as though it was no longer functioning. He reports that the Hawthorn tree appears to be at the end of its life curve and will never recover to be a healthy specimen. He has advised us to apply for a tree removal permit with SDOT and to remove this tree and replace it with another specimen. Because the most significant defect in this Hawthorne tree is at the basal level, Smith reports there is a likelihood of the tree failing completely at that point.This tree has a diameter at standard height reading of 10.5 inches. The overall height of the tree is 20 foot and the drip line radius of the specimen is 12 foot.We are currently researching replacement options, but we will definitely plant another tree in the Hawthorn's place once stump grinding is complete.","03/03/2024",

Design alternatives were considered but are unlikely to mitigate the necessary root loss to repair the sidewalks. Once the trees are removed and the sidewalk is replaced, a more appropriate species will be replanted to compensate for the loss. Prior to finalizing the design plans, options to increase the available root space for the newly planted trees should be considered. To help avoid future sidewalk lifting, root barriers should be installed to limit growth under the sidewalk. Retain and ProtectTree ID#’s 8779, 8780, 8781, 8788, 8789, 8791: Sidewalk repair is not likely to affect long term structural stability, viability or health of these trees. Minor root pruning will be necessary to repair the sidewalk damage. Tree protection fencing should be installed at the edge of the impervious surface and any low hanging branches that could be impacted by construction vehicles should be properly pruned by a certified arborist. It is recommended that any root pruning be completed by a certified arborist.

Major root pruning is likely. It is recommended that the sidewalk be removed by hand. Once the roots of these trees are visible, an arborist will be better able to determine whether these trees can be retained or removed. It is likely that removal is the best option to properly repair the sidewalk and mitigate any risk of tree failure following substantial structural root loss.",,

He recommended action in the parking strip east of our house: There are three significant tree systems in the parking strip east of the house. The parking strip at this address is unusually large and steep. There are two pear trees in the eastern portion of the parking strip that are in fine condition but could use some pruning. The northern tree is bound up the low communication lines and has a dense upper canopy. The southern tree is less dense but could also use some clearance pruning. Both of these trees are in direct competition with the grass and would benefit from mulch in their root zones to assist with water retention and availability of nutrients. In the southwest corner of the parking strip there is a Big Leaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum) with a 23 inch diameter at standard height. There is a power pole just to the southeast of this specimen and the tree has been height reduced repeatedly to accommodate the power lines. This has resulted in an extremely decayed system. Most of the bark has sloughed off of the pedestal region of this tree in the primary column of wood seems to be more than 50% dead. The tree has no vertical sections. All of the main portions of the tree grow out West over the road. Every single one of the scaffold limbs has had the bark stripped off and appears extremely decayed. This tree appears to me as though major branches or the entire system could fail at any time.""","05/08/2023",

So, it's a big cost of thousands of dollars every several years to dig up the sewer line and move it back into position because roots keep shifting it. The sewer pipes are lined with plastic, so it's not that the roots are looking for water; the tree is just too close.  In addition, growth through the utility lines is also an accident waiting for a windstorm that could knock out power and/or internet to the street.""","06/29/2022",

The side is located immediately north to the address in the application. The Seattle GIS parcel ID is 1455600052.This is application to remove and replace a hazard high-risk Alder tree located right on the frontal property line, which makes is occupying right-of-way, with some branches interfering with the cables and power lines directly above them. Arborists evaluated the tree and proposed either (a) removal and replacement, or, alternatively (b) reduction of the tree to a wildlife snag. After considering the available options and associated risks and cost, I intend to remove and replace this problematic tree with SDOT approved species that is compatible with power lines, e.g. Ivory Silk Japanese Tree Lilac, unless SDOT has a different suggestion.The motivation for taking action about this tree at this time is multi-faceted:1. The tree is of poor vigor, with serious structural issues that are progressing. There are two major stems, one of which is hollow and hence is susceptible to toppling at any time, and with increasing probability, given that the crown will get heavier and heavier in the coming months.2. The tree has multiple targets:- cars on the road, given the height of the tree and unbalanced crown with decomposed stem and crown above it;- cables and/or power lines: in case one stem crashes, the other stem may likely pull the cables and/or power lines currently within the crown of the tree;- pedestrians: given that there is only one road, with no sidewalk on the other side, the area around the tree has frequent circulation;- parked cars: my frequent presence on the site creates risk for people and cars that are parked in front of the properly and immediately next to the tree;- persons gardening the land behind the tree: the stem that is hollow and supports a heavy and unbalanced crown put those working within the height of the tree at risk;3. There were two incidents of crashing trees within 50 feets of the subject tree, one of which occurred in last week and another a few months ago, on which occasion the tree crashed within inches of my car (See picture attached). Given my planned frequent presence on the site in the coming months, it is a very high risk to work in the proximity of the subject tree and it is difficult to perform any routing maintenance due to the risks related to work on such declining tree.4. The tree is located within ECA and fairly close to a steep slope. Another tree had just crashes within 20 feet of the subject tree and toppling of the subject tree can be reasonable considered a question of time. A healthy tree replacing the subject tree will ultimately help the stabilize the steep slope for many years to come and will also allow planing of additional trees and bushes that will further help to stabilize the soil nearby the subject tree. I would be happy to plant even two trees, space permitting, that are compatible with power lines and have great potential to develop healthy root system that will benefit the area for decades.Alternatives to removal and replacement:A significant amount of time has been spent to consider alternatives, but any work on this tree is going to be quite risky due to very poor structure and challenging topography behind the tree. It is theoretically possible to perform maintenance by removing invasive ivy and performing major pruning to lower the weight of the crown, hence somewhat reducing the overall risks. Yet, such approach would be very costly to initiate and would require ongoing maintenance for this hazard tree that is unlikely to serve for many more years anyways. Also, there is no consensus how to address the problematic hollow stem, which can crash at any time. Removal of the affected stem isn't feasible either. With that being said, replacement seems most reasonable in the long term perspective. See ISA Basic Tree Assessment for more details.",,

Two similar trees have already failed and struck his home. Mr Torgerson is concerned that the remaining trees will fall and cause additional damage to life and property. The 2019 inspection confirmed the presence of Kretzschmaria deusta, a common decay pathogen in urban trees. Trees that are infected with K. deusta may eventually fail as the decay weakens roots and the wood in the base of the tree. In fact, the recent tree failure in the area (Tree #2) is likely due to the presence and proliferation of the fungus. In 2019 an Level 2 Tree Risk Assessment was completed on 5 similar trees on the property. One tree has since been removed and one tree failed and struck the house, causing severe damage. Two trees (1 & 5) were determined to be moderate risk at the time. It is likely that the risk categorization of these trees has increased since the initial inspection and it is recommended that they be removed before root failure occurs and cause additional damage to the nearby home or compromise the safety of the residents.","04/03/2023",

During the past 5 years the tree has continued to lean further into the road, now at a 45 degree estimated angle.In June of 2021 an SDOT Arborist named Whit Bouton did a site visit to assess the Rosebud tree.  Whit's conclusion was that the tree should be removed - the increasingly leaning trunk is interfering with required street clearances and overall vigor is not the greatest.An SDOT approved arborist has been selected for the removal - Jordan Franksen of Vitalitree LLC (ISA certified arborist PN-8394A).  Jordan recommends exploring the possibility of not replacing the tree due to site constraints.  Specifically, the Rosebud that needs to be removed is very close to another Rosebud Tree, and immediately adjacent to a utility box. Plus, there are overhead powerlines immediately above.","10/28/2021",

The exact placement of the vault can't be determined until the area is dug-up, due to many existing utilities. The actual digging appears to be able to leave the tree, but we may be in the CRZ at that time. Again we would prefer to leave it alone, but seek permission to remove/ replace prior to any activity.

The site is found on a moderately steep slope and contains a staircase that is used frequently by locals. The objective of the work covered in this scope is to lower the likelihood of tree, branch, and/or other tree part failure and impact primarily caused by the fungal pathogen Kretzschmaria deusta, also known as “brittle cinder.” K. deusta significantly weakens the tree and causes great instability in tree structure. Six (6) bigleaf maples (Acer macrophyllum) that exhibited external symptoms of the pathogen have previously been removed from the site. During tree work and site preparation for follow up restoration, three (3) additional multi-stemmed bigleaf maples were discovered to also exhibit external symptoms of the pathogen.

Note: There is a large trunk section on the north zelkova tree which grows slightly into the right of way and shows signs of prior truck damage. To remove this section would likely cause irreversible decline. I think that by removing the surrounding foliage the trunk section will be visible to trucks and more easily avoided. If it continues to be an issue, removal and replacement of the entire tree will need to be considered.   -Reduce branches to clear building by about 6' -Remove low hanging north branch over sidewalk from north tree to improve sign visibility-Remove other small north and south oriented lateral lateral branches to improve sign visibility -Cleanup and haul away all wood and debrisFour Hedge Maples (Clay St. Parking)Pruning objectives:-Meet required SDOT clearances (14' over the street and 8' over the sidewalk)-Improve visibility of parked cars (there have been security issues)-Provide clearance for building and vine maplesPruning Treatment:-Remove or reduce low branches to meet required SDOT clearances.
